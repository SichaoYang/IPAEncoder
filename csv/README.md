### Files
+ consonants.csv
+ vowels.csv
+ phonemes.csv (working file, consonants + vowels + stress)
### Notes
+ Pulmonic, affricates and co-articulated consonants are included.
+ Some categorization may be controversial, but the words will be further encoded, so the binary representation is useful as long as it captures the similarities and differences between phonemes.
	+ Linguo­labial as coronal, alveolo-palatal as coronal + dorsal, palatal as dorsal.
	+ IPA did not define the roundedness of [ə] and [ɐ], but they are more often unrounded and thus classified as so.
+ Stress is encoded as one phoneme. See if recurrent models can handle it.
